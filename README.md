Future Engineers
====

We are Emilia Lever, Sofia Fernandez, and Antonio Franco, a dedicated team representing the Thomas Jefferson School in the Future Engineers category of the WRO® 2025. Guided by our passion for robotics and inspired by the 2025 season theme “The Future of Robots”—which explores how autonomous systems can shape tomorrow’s world, from smart cities and sustainable infrastructure to space exploration—we have embarked on an ambitious journey to design, build, and program an autonomous four-wheeled robotic vehicle capable of navigating a randomized course on its own.

## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.


## Robot Objectives


## Mobility Management

Our robot, "POP", short for People is nice, works with the help of two motors. For the movement of the rear-axle we implemented a red "GeekServo" direct current (DC) motor, we chose it since it has a strong online community that already implements this motor using micro:bit software and hardware. It also has LEGO compatability, making it easier to adapt to our design. Our robot POP has a gray "GeekServo" servo motor as well. This controls the front-axle and provides the high-precision that is needed. This motor allows us to program it using degrees, which fits our team's need for accuracy.

The design of our chassis was made from scratch using Autodesk Fusion 360. Since the motors we agreed upon were compatible with LEGO components, it was only natural that our design was based on these same pieces. We have a simple structure inspired on a ladder-frame chassis, since our main objectives can be accomplished with a reliable base.
